	<h2>Jodi Jang</h2>
	<img src="jj_picture.jpg" width="200" class="bio-pic">
	<p>Jodi Jang is a passionate third year student in the Computer Science Software Engineering
	Specialist Co-op Program at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She is fluent is multiple 
	programming languages including Java, Python, and C, and she has used these programming 
	languages in various projects. Additionally, Jodi has experience using Android Studio to create
	user-friendly interfaces and creating Bash scripts to automate laborious processes. Furthermore,
	she has strong knowledge of software concepts including Object-Oriented design and various 
	design patterns. Jodi has gained hands-on programming experience designing algorithms, creating
	software, and writing technical documents while working at Thales Canada. Some of the projects 
	she worked on includes creating software to implement a post-processing procedure for analysis 
	and comparison of sensor data and developing a procedure for benchmarking computer performance 
	while running a program. She used strong verbal and written communication skills to present, 
	analyze, and document these projects.</p>
	
	<h2>Tia Jang</h2>
	<img src="tj_picture.jpg" width="200" class="bio-pic">
	<p>Tia Jang is currently a third year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, 
	studying Computer Science and specializing in Software Engineering. She has more than 
	four years of programming experience, including Java, C, C++, and Python languages. 
	Over the years, she worked independently and collaborated with teams to produce a variety 
	of programs. Using Android Studio, she collaborated with a team to code an interactive 
	shopping application that featured object-oriented design and user-friendly layouts. 
	Most recently she has interned at Thales as a research engineer, where she designed and 
	implemented an autoexposure algorithm for a camera. This algorithm ensured the cameraâ€™s 
	exposure was correctly controlled to take well-exposed images in a dynamic environment, 
	and applied research of image quality and multi-threading. She communicated effectively 
	with a team and through comprehensive technical reports. She is passionate about applying 
	her skills and learning new skills to provide innovative solutions to challenges. </p>

	<img src="junaid_picture.jpg" width="200" class="bio-pic">
	<p>Junaid has an ambitious goal of becoming a Software developer in the near future. Currently he is a third-year student who is specializing in software engineering at University of Toronto Scarborough campus. Junaid has worked in many projects and gained experience in multiple languages such as Java, Python and C#. Junaid gained interest in computer science during high school where he started learning on his own to develop his own projects. Some of his most successful projects includes implementing an interactive command line and developing a 2D platform game. Junaid's 2D platform game was a team project and consisted of self-learning of unity and C# which took the duration of a few months. The interactive command line was also a project worked alongside 3 other team members in an agile SDLC environment. Frequent communication with team members and client was necessary in ensuring a successful project. Junaid hopes to continue developing more projects and acquire more skill as an everlasting enthusiast for technology.</p>
